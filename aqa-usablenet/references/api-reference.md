## Suites

### List Suites
```
GET /a11y/suites
```
Optional query params: `flowType` (`functional` | `keyboard`), `crawlerType` (`crawler` | `singlePageCrawler`)

Response:
```json
{
  "suites": [
    {
      "id": "TS612",
      "name": "example.com",
      "description": "",
      "locationId": "...",
      "numFlows": 3,
      "numCrawlers": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

### Get Suite Details
```
GET /a11y/suites/{suiteId}
```
Returns full suite object including nested `flows[]` and `crawlers[]` arrays with their IDs, names, URLs, device info, and connection settings.

---

## Flows

Flows are single-page user flows within a suite. Each flow has a starting URL and optional device/connection settings.

### Get Flow Details
```
GET /a11y/suites/{suiteId}/flows/{flowId}
```
Returns: `id`, `name`, `description`, `url` (starting URL), `deviceId`, `deviceScreenIndex`, `connectionSettings`, `type` (`functional` | `keyboard`).

### Create Flow
```
POST /a11y/suites/{suiteId}/flows/{sourceType}/create
```
`sourceType` is one of:
- `url` — provide a starting URL and manual settings
- `settings` — clone settings from an existing flow
- `flow` — clone an existing flow entirely

**Body for `sourceType=url`:**
```json
{
  "name": "Homepage flow",
  "description": "Tests the homepage",
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "deviceId": "D774",
  "deviceScreenIndex": 0,
  "connectionSettings": {
    "cookies": [],
    "headers": [],
    "hosts": [],
    "auth": [],
    "sslValidation": true,
    "timeout": 30
  }
}
```
Only `name` and `url` are required. `deviceId` defaults to the suite's default device.

**Body for `sourceType=settings`:**
```json
{
  "name": "New flow from settings",
  "url": "https://example.com/page2",
  "linkedFlowId": "T4143"
}
```
`linkedFlowId` is the existing flow whose settings (device, connection) to copy.

**Body for `sourceType=flow`:**
```json
{
  "linkedFlowId": "T4143"
}
```
Clones the flow entirely.

Response: `{ "part": { "id": "T4200", "name": "..." } }`

### Update Flow
```
POST /a11y/suites/{suiteId}/flows/{flowId}/update
```
Body (all fields optional, null values are ignored):
```json
{
  "name": "Updated name",
  "description": "Updated description",
  "url": "https://example.com/new-page",
  "deviceId": "D774",
  "deviceScreenIndex": 0,
  "connectionSettings": { ... }
}
```

### Delete Flow
```
POST /a11y/suites/{suiteId}/flows/{flowId}/delete
```
No request body. Permanently removes the flow from the suite.

---

## Crawlers

Crawlers are page collection configurations that crawl multiple pages from a starting URL.

### Get Crawler Details

```
Returns: `id`, `name`, `description`, `url`, `deviceId`, `depth`, `limit`, `collectionType` (`crawler` | `sitemap` | `spreadsheet` | `staticsite`).

**Body for `sourceType=url`:**
```json
{
  "name": "Site crawler",
  "description": "Crawls example.com",
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "deviceId": "D774",
  "depth": 3,
  "limit": 100
}
```
- `depth` — deepest crawl level from starting page
